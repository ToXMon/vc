# Rule: Generating a Task List from User Requirements

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on user requirements, feature requests, or existing documentation. The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[feature-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-user-profile-editing.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive Requirements:** The user provides a feature request, task description, or points to existing documentation
2.  **Analyze Requirements:** The AI analyzes the functional requirements, user needs, and implementation scope from the provided information
3.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the requirements analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. **IMPORTANT: Always include task 0.0 "Create feature branch" as the first task, unless the user specifically requests not to create a branch.** Use your judgement on how many additional high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on your requirements. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
5.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the requirements.
6.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and requirements, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
7.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
8.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[feature-name].md`, where `[feature-name]` describes the main feature or task being implemented (e.g., if the request was about user profile editing, the output is `tasks-user-profile-editing.md`).

## Output Format

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.
- `path/to/another/file.tsx` - Brief description (e.g., API route handler for data submission).
- `path/to/another/file.test.tsx` - Unit tests for `another/file.tsx`.
- `lib/utils/helpers.ts` - Brief description (e.g., Utility functions needed for calculations).
- `lib/utils/helpers.test.ts` - Unit tests for `helpers.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
